Sprite Animator


This application animates between two images upon keypress. The purpose of this was for me to familiarize myself with Java GUI and some of its capabilities. 

I doubt very much that this is the 'proper' way to animate, but I just wanted to try it out. The images in the source code are .pngs that my friends and I made one Friday night at college and it was actually pretty rewarding to something work. Feel free to modify!

Time Animator


This is more similar to what I had in mind before actually doing the programming that night we did Sprite Animator. I had originally wanted to use a timer to animate through the images. Now I am! Although it doesn't exactly work perfectly... Still working on it!
